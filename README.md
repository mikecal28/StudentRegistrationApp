# StudentRegistrationApp
This is a homework assignment for Software Development Fundamentals: Section 19.

There might be a few bugs with the 'quick search' functionality.

  a. Add/edit/delete records from a student cohort registrations database.
  
  b. Mentioned records include:
    
    - Courses for students to take.
    
    - Cohorts that include students, an instructor, and a course.
    
    - Student registrations for course cohorts.
